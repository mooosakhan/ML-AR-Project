## Introduction
This project implements a real-time object detection system using a webcam and the YOLOv4-Tiny deep learning model. The system can detect and label multiple everyday objects such as person, book, bottle, mobile phone, and laptop.

---

## Objectives
- Perform real-time object detection  
- Achieve high speed using YOLOv4-Tiny  
- Understand blob and tensor preprocessing  
- Visualize detection performance using graphs  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- YOLOv4-Tiny  
- COCO Dataset  
- Webcam  

---

## System Architecture
The system captures frames from a webcam, preprocesses them into blobs, passes them through the YOLOv4-Tiny model, and displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## Detection Performance Analysis
- Bar chart showing confidence scores for detected objects  
- Performance comparison of different YOLO models in terms of FPS  

---

## Blob and Tensor Explanation
- **Tensor:** A multi-dimensional array used in deep learning  
- **Blob:** A preprocessed tensor created from an image using OpenCV, including resizing, normalization, and channel reordering

## Features
- Real-time detection  
- High FPS performance  
- Detects 80+ object classes  
- Lightweight model  
- Snapshot capture support  

---

## Applications
- Surveillance systems  
- Smart CCTV  
- Robotics  
- Automation  
- Retail analytics  
- Educational demonstrations  

---

## Limitations
- Lower accuracy than full YOLOv4  
- Limited detection of very small objects  
- CPU-based inference  

---

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv4-Tiny. The added bar charts help visualize detection confidence and model performance, making the system easier to analyze and understand.
